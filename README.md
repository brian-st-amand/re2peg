# Regex to PEG

Type a JavaScript-compatible regex into the text field. Your PEG will appear in the text area below.

As your grammar grows in length, move segments into new rules. You can create as many rules as you want, which provides readibility for even the most complex grammars.

Test your PEG (using JavaScript) here: https://pegjs.org/online

All major languages have their own PEG implementations. The grammar will be identical to the one seen here, but sometimes the delimiters for characters/strings will vary.
